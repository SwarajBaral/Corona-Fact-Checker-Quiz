# Corona-Fact-Checker-Quiz
A quiz game app that debunks myths sorrounding the deadly Covid-19

# Description

In this time of utter chaos and distress, there needs to be a well defined system for people to realize their responsibilities of maintaining distance from the outside world, stay isolated for as long as possible and most importantly stay aware about the virus and its effects at all times. To facilitate proper knowledge and information about this virus in a fun way, we have come up with a mobile application based quiz that will help people know about the Corona virus and its effects on human body. Our app combines knowledge with fun, the best way there is to learn about anything.

# Hardware & Software Requirements :-

The essential hardware component of this project is an android/iOS based smartphone which is pretty common these days. This application will be made available on all the above mentioned smartphones and is an extremely light weight app. CFC (Corona Fact Checker) doesn’t require extreme hardware requirements to run as the GUI is pretty basic and its memory usage is also not that significant. This app will require a proper network connection as the data has to be transmitted and received. The size of the app will be some megabytes and will be completely free to use. This is all the hardware and software requirements that MCFC needs.

# Process Flow :-

First the user will open the app and will be met with 2 buttons on the starting screen, one will start the game and the other can be used to ask any question about COVID-19 . Then the app will proceed to display a set of 5 questions. These questions will mostly be about myths about this virus. Users have to select the answer they feel is right, and based on that they will be awarded scores. Every time the game restarts, the questionnaire shuffles and new questions are added in to the mix of old questions. In this way the game never gets boring. And the best part is that there is also a score system that lets people see how many answers they got correct.
The ‘Ask a Question About Covid-19’ button is another important feature of this application. Once the user hits this button, he/she will be taken to a page where they can type in the subject of the question and the actual message. The message is sent to the covid-19 fact check unit of the Press information Bureau (PIB). PIB receives messages on their email id that is ‘pibfactcheck@gmail.com’  and responds to various queries and questions related to covid19 in a defined time frame. Their response is usually pretty fast and we have used this facility for the benefit of the users. They can use this service directly from within the app to check about various internet myths and rumors surrounding this disease. The email is sent via gmail through the user’s mail id.

# Need Of This Application

Fake news and internet rumors about covid19 is at large. People do not need to be more stressed than they already are and by this application, they can check about any facts and myths related to coronavirus before blindly believing it. And by using our app, they can sleep a bit easier knowing that they are fully aware about this disease. CFC will make sure that every citizen knows about this disease to the fullest extent and it delivers information in a fun way. If more and more people use this application then we can curb myths about covid19 and coronavirus and people will remain prepared if anything happens to them.
